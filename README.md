A simple Go client for the Danbooru API to download images in a batch. Currently maxed out at 2 tags per search, however if you are Danbooru Gold member then this limit gets increased to 6. 

To take advantage of that, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and enter the required credentials. 

Just make sure you keep said `.env` file in the same directory as the executable.
